## The bug

Please give a brief but clear explanation of the issue.
If you can, include a complete working example that demonstrates the bug. **Check it can run without modifications.**

It will be helpful if you run the following command and paste the results:

```
textual diagnose
```

If you don't have the `textual` command on your path, you may have forgotten to install the `textual-dev` package.

Feel free to add screenshots and / or videos. These can be very helpful!
